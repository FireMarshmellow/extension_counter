Description:
This script creates folders with names starting from 0000 to 9999 and waits until there is one file with each of the desired extensions (.jpg, .mp4, .procreate) in the folder. Then, it moves the folder to a completed directory.

How to use
Set the directory path where the folders should be created by modifying the directory_path variable.
Set the extensions of the files to look for by modifying the extensions list.
Run the script.
Note: You may need to adjust the script to fit your specific use case.
